# zero_down
I have choosen problem 2 and I have extracted data , cleaned the data (shape file) using geopandas library and downloaded  the csv file of that cleaned data frame.For backend, I have used mongodb with express frame work and mongoose ORM library. 
With the output of the queries, I have performed visualization using chart.js by connecting frontend and backend using REST api.

 I uploaded the result of the query as a collection in mongodb. First we should start the server which is visualize.js. Then we should run index.html file.

I have also many ideas for performing query. But due to time constraint was able to performe only few.
