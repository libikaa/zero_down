I have choosen problem 2 and I have extracted data and I have cleaned the data (shape file) using geopandas library.
I have downloaded the csv file of that cleaned data frame.
I have used mongodb for backend.
I have performed queries based on the data.
Using that output of that query I have made visualization using chart.js by connecting frontend and backend using REST api.

I have also many ideas for performing query.
But due to time constraint I have performed only few.
